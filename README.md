# Blender Addon: Toggle Emulate MMB & Numpad

<!-- # toggle_emulate_mmb_numpad -->
This addon makes it simple and easy to set up Blender for e.g. a lightweight portable setup. Perfect with a laptop 2-in-1 and stylus pen, where Numpad and a Mouse with or without Middle Mouse Button are lacking entirely.


- `;` toggles the number keys to become Numpad Keys for viewport orientation and view snapping
- `'` or `"` toggles Middle Mouse Button emulation, so the stylus can be used with Alt (or one of its buttons mapped to Alt) for orbiting and 3D viewport navigation

- Highly recommend downloading a stylus programming application like ['HP Pen Control'](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJ3VGVQ4NMP) to give easy, though minimal control over programming of stylus buttons. Mapping one to right-click and another to 'Alt' frees up the left hand for hotkeys, while the stylus can be used for drawing and navigation

- Especially useful for stylus operation with QuickTools ([QuickShape](https://gumroad.com/jamajurabaev#tOWta), [QuickDeform](https://gumroad.com/alksndr), [QuickCurve](https://gumroad.com/jamajurabaev#EmBrX)) on a lightweight setup

- Saves figuring out how to add the hidden toggle operators to the keymap, or going into preferences to toggle them

- Far easier than setting up AutoHotkey for stylus buttons. The keymap seems fairly unused in Blender at present

- Soon to add visual indicator of toggle status so you can *free your mind* for imagination
